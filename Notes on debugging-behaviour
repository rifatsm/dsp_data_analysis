Hey Rifat -- I've attached a data file. It contains the following columns:
userName
assignment
normalLaunches -- The number of normal launches where the number of diagnostic print statements was > 0
testLaunches -- The number of test launches where the number of diagnostic print statements was > 0
debugSessionConuts -- The number of debugger sessions

Using these data, see if you can come up with some conclusions about. Some questions to start you off:
Are there "groups" or "clusters" of students who tend to use print statements more than the debugger?

Basic:
# There are 176 unique students in the course (according to the data).
# There are total 567 project submissions. Each student submits atmost 4 projects. 

- How many students use the debugger at all? 
# 147 students use the debugger in at least one of their projects
# 406 projects have at least once launched the debugger

- How many students use print statements at all? 
# 126 students used DPS at least once (either in normalLaunch or testLaunch)
# 224 projects have at least a DPS in either a normalLaunch or a testLaunch 
# 164 projects have at least one DPS launch in normal launches
# 217 projects have at least one DPS launch in test launches
# 157 projects have at least one DPS launch in both normal launches and test launches

Project-wise:
- Basic
# 164 submissions/students for Project 1
# 144 submissions/students for Project 2 
# 134 submissions/students for Project 3
# 125 submissions/students for Project 4

- Debugger Session
# 124 students have at least once used the debugger for Project 1
# 110 students have at least once used the debugger for Project 2
# 86 students have at least once used the debugger for Project 3
# 86 students have at least once used the debugger for Project 4

# 49.984 is the mean debugSessionCount (non-zero data points) for Project 1 
# 89.8 is the mean debugSessionCount (non-zero data points) for Project 2 
# 53.477 is the mean debugSessionCount (non-zero data points) for Project 3 
# 60.605 is the mean debugSessionCount (non-zero data points) for Project 4 

- Normal Launches 
# 62 students have at least one DPS in normal launches for Project 1
# 73 students have at least one DPS in normal launches for Project 2
# 29 students have at least one DPS in normal launches for Project 3
# 0 student have at least one DPS in normal launches for Project 4

# 175.516 is the mean number of DPS in normal launches for Project 1
# 192.082 is the mean number of DPS in normal launches for Project 2
# 53.517 is the mean number of DPS in normal launches for Project 3
# 0 is the mean number of DPS in normal launches for Project 4

- Test Launches 
# 76 students have at least one DPS in test launches for Project 1
# 95 students have at least one DPS in test launches for Project 2
# 46 students have at least one DPS in test launches for Project 3
# 0 student have at least one DPS in test launches for Project 4

# 525.566 is the mean number of DPS in test launches for Project 1
# 786.347 is the mean number of DPS in test launches for Project 2
# 200.87 is the mean number of DPS in test launches for Project 3
# 0 is the mean number of DPS in test launches for Project 4
